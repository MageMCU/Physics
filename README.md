## Physics
- Physics is the science that relates the properties of matter and energy excluding chemical effects. This repository is a study in programming the Dynamics of Physics without considering its cohort, Statics, except when necessary. Statics and Dynamics is a branch of Engineering Mechanics that considers the action of forces on bodies at rest and in motion. The math and concepts of the physical science will be applied to programming the motion of robotics.


## Testing Platform
- This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is described here. The Arduino Uno board comes with a removable MCU.
- **PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. 
- **Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor and it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The best thing about VSCode, it is free.

## In Development
- As of 20230826, we're just beginning...
